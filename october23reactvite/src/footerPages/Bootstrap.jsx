          <p>
            Bootstrap is a powerful, feature-packed frontend toolkit. Build
            anything—from prototype to production—in minutes.{" "}

        <div
          className="quickStart border-bottom"

            1. Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the
            `meta name=`viewport` tag as well for proper responsive behavior in
            mobile devices.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            2. Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS. Place the link tag in the head
            for our CSS, and the script tag for our JavaScript bundle including
            Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips before the
            closing /body. Learn more about our CDN links.{" "}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You can also include Popper and our JS separately. If you don’t plan
            to use dropdowns, popovers, or tooltips, save some kilobytes by not
            including Popper.

            Bootstrapped page. Now you can start building with Bootstrap by
