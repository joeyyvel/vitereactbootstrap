              Let`s start this JavaScript cheat sheet with how we can include
              JavaScript in an HTML file. There are 2 ways of doing so:{" "}
            </p>
            <p>1. Internal Including of Java Script</p>
            <p>
              In this, we write the JavaScript code in the HTML pages itself
              inside the script tag.
            </p>
            <p>2. External Including of Javascript</p>
            <p>
              In this method, we create a JavaScript document with an extension
              of .js and include it in the HTML page.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
